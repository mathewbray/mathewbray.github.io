<span id="more-650"></span>

This is a list of items that you may find in a tech’s backpack or tool bag. Depending on what you work on, you may not need more than half the items!

## Core Items

These items are the critical main items that may be a standard part of your kit.

*   **Backpack**
    *   _Recommended:_ [GORUCK GR1](https://www.google.com/search?q=goruck+gr1&btnI) – Pick your size: 21L or 26L (I use 21L). Put your contact info on it! Get pouches to keep it organized.

    *   [Klein Tools](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=klein+tools+tech+backpack) makes Tech Bags and Backpacks
*   **Laptop** – A tablet with dongles will get annoying real quick, also avoid laptops with ethernet ports that “fold out.”
